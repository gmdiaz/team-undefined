What is the future of Tech? That answer is *Undefined*.

We are a startup located in the Pioneer Valley and we are looking to simplify the way that people interact with each other.

Our Goal:
---------
Let’s face it, in this day and age you are busy. Work, school, family, friends - everybody pulls you in so many different directions and and before you know it your schedule is a confusing mess. Undefined hopes to connect you with your schedule in a brand new way.

We intend to create a system where you can enter your schedule and determine your free time. Then, when a friend asks “Hey, when can you hang out?”, all you have to do is add your friend and our app will determine the times where you both can meet. No paper. No back and forth. Simple.

Meet The Team:
--------------
*Giovanna Diaz:* As a native of Dallas, Texas, Giovanna still can’t comprehend an East Coast winter. (Snow up to my elbows? How do people do this every year!?) She is a CS and Mathematics dboule Her technical skills include knowledge of front-end web design (HTML, CSS, Javascript), and a solid understanding of Java. She has a great interest in UI/UX design and jumps at any chance she gets to work with users. Previous CS classes include Programming Techniques for the Interactive Arts, Microprocessors and Assembly Language, Advanced Programming Techniques, and Interactive Web Documents. Besides her classes in CS, Giovanna has also took Design Workshop I, where she got to experiment with the basics of design through different artistic mediums. This class made her realize that she cannot deny her love for art and design. She also completed an Introduction to Philosophy class which she ended up enjoying a lot more than she thought she would. (She found that having a younger sibling really helped her hone the art of arguing!)

*Colin McGinnis:* From Hingham, Massachusetts. His technical skills include minor front-end web design (HTML), a solid understanding of Java and a moderate understanding of C. Computers were always a big part of his life, so programming just feels right to him as a profession. He has a lot of interest in learning more HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Aspirations of game design have always been big for him, as well as web design. At UMASS Amherst he took clas such as Computer Science 230 Computer Systems Principles, Computer Science 220 Programming Methodology, and Computer Science 240 Reasoning Under Uncertainty, along with all the prerequisites that came with them. Two classes that heavily impacted his education were Comic Art in North America and Introduction to Ethics.
