What is the future of Tech? That answer is *Undefined*.

We are a startup located in the Pioneer Valley and we are looking to simplify the way that people interact with each other.

Our Goal:
---------
Let’s face it, in this day and age you are busy. Work, school, family, friends - everybody pulls you in so many different directions and and before you know it your schedule is a confusing mess. Undefined hopes to connect you with your schedule in a brand new way.

We intend to create a system where you can enter your schedule and determine your free time. Then, when a friend asks “Hey, when can you hang out?”, all you have to do is add your friend and our app will determine the times where you both can meet. No paper. No back and forth. Simple.

Meet The Team:
--------------
**Giovanna Diaz:** As a native of Dallas, Texas, Giovanna still can’t comprehend an East Coast winter. (Snow up to my elbows? How do people do this every year!?) She is a CS and Mathematics double major at Smith College, but is also fond of singing, art, and eating chcocolate. Her technical skills include knowledge of front-end web design (HTML, CSS, Javascript), and a solid understanding of Java. She has a great interest in UI/UX design and jumps at any chance she gets to work with users. Previous CS classes include Programming Techniques for the Interactive Arts, Microprocessors and Assembly Language, Advanced Programming Techniques, and Interactive Web Documents. Besides her classes in CS, Giovanna has also taken Design Workshop I, where she got to experiment with the basics of design through different artistic mediums. This class made her realize that she cannot deny her love for art and design. She also completed an Introduction to Philosophy class that she ended up enjoying a lot more than she thought she would. (She found that having a younger sibling really helped her hone the art of argument!)

**Colin McGinnis:** From Hingham, Massachusetts. His technical skills include minor front-end web design (HTML), a solid understanding of Java and a moderate understanding of C. Computers were always a big part of his life, so programming just feels right to him as a profession. He has a lot of interest in learning more HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Aspirations of game design have always been big for him, as well as web design. At UMASS Amherst he took clas such as Computer Science 230 Computer Systems Principles, Computer Science 220 Programming Methodology, and Computer Science 240 Reasoning Under Uncertainty, along with all the prerequisites that came with them. Two classes that heavily impacted his education were Comic Art in North America and Introduction to Ethics.

**Kiernan Drohan:** From Westborough/Northborough, Mass. Homegrown programmer of 2 generations, dreams in binary and got his foot in the door at a major corporation, EMC. Familiar with C, Java, PHP and some dinosaur languages, consistently plays videogames and looks for different ways to optimize and secure data, cryptography and security coding nerd and built my first computer at 8 years old, i never looked back. My newest interest in a language is SAP due to its very integrative and innovative architecture. My 2 favorite courses in comp sci before are 187 and 220 due to its actual practical applications. My 2 favorite non Comp Sci courses are GeoScience and English.

**Justin Coon:** From Longmeadow, Mass but currently living in Frisco, Texas. Very solid understanding of Java including experience in Android development. Proficient in C/C++ and LaTeX. Interested in security and databases.

**Thai Nguyen:** An Asian geek who sleeps with Java every night but falls in love with Python instead, who desires to solve challenging back-end problems but also fascinated in creating fabulous UI design. 

**Santiago De La Torre:** I’m coming all the way from Barcelona, Spain and I am a huge soccer fan. I am expecting Lionel Messi to destroy Real Madrid this season, but in the meantime I am a Computer Science major in my senior year. I am really looking forward to graduate this coming May and maybe work in Yelp with my friend, afterwards. I am more of a back-end type of person and I really like DataBases, JavaScript, and looking forward to learn some WebGL. I have always liked the “behind the scenes” of everything. My technical skills include; Database(MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle), Java, Visual Basic, C++/CLI, C++, C, and learning Swift(on my own). My doctor thinks I am a healthy person, but I am allergic to Windows “Operating System.”
