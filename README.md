Overlap is a multi-platform application that allows users to detect overlaps between their schedule and their friend's schedule. In that way, individuals can find the perfect time to meet for any given purpose. With the "Priority" feature, a  user can prioritize their free time. Overlap will then take their priorities in to consideration when comparing the schedules.

Overlap is great for college students and professionals alike. It will include connections with Facebook and LinkedIn allowing the users to find their friends with ease. Overlap solves your scheduling problems. If you need to meet a friend, simply have Overlap compare your schedules. There is no back and forth emails, or accidentally forgetting a commitment. This will not only enhance your social interactions, cutting out the frustration of scheduling, but will also increase your number of social interactions.
