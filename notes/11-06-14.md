Highlights
----------
-**Highlight 1:** Discussed the upcoming deadlines and when we want to get the app bare bones done by - the group concensus was by the end of Thanksgiving Break!  
-**Highlight 2:** PA04 - Giovanna had made the organized googledoc for the work - there was a soft deadline put in place to have the majority of the information done by the end of the weekend  
-**Highlight 3:** There are still talks of getting a domain name... OOverlap.com is taken, which is a huge bummer and nothing else really lit our fire so we are holding off on that for now and Thai said that he would get us set up on Heroku  

Issues
------
No pressing issues were brought up in this meeting, besides the fact that the end of the semester is coming up a whole heck of a lot faster than we thought and we really need to get seriously cracking on the website -- hence the self-deadline! 

Tasks
-----
**@Everyone: Work on getting the PA04 information done by the end of the weekend**
