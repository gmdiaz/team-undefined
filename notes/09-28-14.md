Issues
------
###1. App Name:  
Problem: There was some discussion and conflict over what the application name would be. Everybody had a different idea.  
Solution: We will create a poll on the team Facebook Group and everybody can vote on their favorite one  

###2. Google API:  
Problem: We wanted things out of Google that we were not sure we could get...   
Solution: Justin said he would look more in to the Google API to make sure we could do what we were hoping to do.
