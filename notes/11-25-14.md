Notes from Meeting: 11-25-14
============================

Details
-------
**Date:** November 25, 2014  
**Time:** 3 - 4:15   
**Participants:** Justin Coon, Thai Nguyen, Giovanna Diaz, Santiago de la Torre  


Highlights
----------
-**Hosting the Site of Mongolab:** Justin got the site hosted on MongoLab (before this class) so that we don't have to worry about using it locally (specifically Giovanna whose Mongo is more like Mon-don'tGo... hah... hahaha)
-**Creating a New User:** Santiago completed this task! People can now make new accounts even if they don't have a google account. They will just use the calendar that we have in the database and add events accordingly.  
-**Richards:** We got to talk to Richards and ask some questions regarding the layout / database and did a fun little demo for him. 

Issues
------
-**1. Calendar Events:**  
Problem: The divs are acting weirdly in the friends profile pictures  
Solution: Bite the bullet and hardcode the width of the images - although it was a good attempt at trying to make it as dynamic as possible  
-**2. Profile pictures - Friends:**  
Problem: The profile pictures keep bumping around and generally not doing what I want them to do...    
Solution: Hardcode the widths of the images... not the nicest answer but there ya go  
-**2. ToolTip: **  
Problem: The tool tip does NOT look how we want it to - yipes!    
Solution: Inspect using the developer tools to see what styling it's implementing
