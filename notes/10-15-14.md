Issues
------
-**1. Scheduling Different Meetings at the Same Time:**  
Problem: What happens if you try to schedule a meeting with a few different people (on the app) and give them the same times?  
Solution: The application will give you a notice that you are giving that time out to different people. Then, while you schedule and approve events with other people, your calendar will update so that nobody else can pick that time slot.
