#Project 1 Feedback

Your idea is really quite novel! It's interesting that existing DYI scheduling web services (Doodle, when2meet, etc.) don't cross-check schedules with each other. (Like, say a user says on one Doodle that they aren't available on Monday at 1pm, shouldn't it be carried (or at least somehow communicated) throughout other Doodles?) 

Referring to your Trello board, which is fantastic, I love that your team is taking time to understand your competitors (in this case, scheduleshare.net) and how you can improve. It's an awesome attitude and it will get you far!

I think it's early to give y'all suggestions on implementing some of your ideas, though I think you should take a look at the Socket.io (http://socket.io) library if you decide to implement chat functionality. It has sample code of how to build a basic chat app (I believe in 6 lines of code?) which you may find useful!

All in all, awesome job! I look forward to seeing how your project evolves!
