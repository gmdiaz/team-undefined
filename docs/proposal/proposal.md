**Santiago De La Torre**
Database Analyst

>Software engineer brought from the darkest side of Europe looking forward to start writing malicious code. In the meantime, he loves desining databases and fairy-rail queries to store and retrieve data in a minimal time possible. Systems programming is his passion and C isn't only his favourite "vitamin."

**Thai Nguyen**
UI/UX Designer, Software Engineer

>An Asian geek who sleeps with Java every night but falls in love with Python instead, who desires to solve challenging back-end problems but also fascinated in creating fabulous UI design. Being a person who favors "high entropy" (in other words: "utmost laziness"), he loves utilizing his computer to save his time and work, that's why he is now craving to learn about Machine Learning and Information Retrieval.

**Giovanna Diaz**
Project Manager, Graphic Designer

>A Dallas, Texas native, Giovanna Diaz is a junior at Smith College double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. She also has a great interest in design and will jump at any chance she gets to use the Adobe Creative Suite!

**Colin McGinnis**
UI Designer, Software Engineer

>Grew up in the South Shore of Massachusetts, in Hingham, MA specifically. He's a junior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, studying Computer Science. He has an interest in design, which he hopes to explore in working with User Interfaces, and has an interest in working in both front end and back end development as well. 

**Justin Coon**
Software Engineer, Technology Integration Specialist

>A sophomore at University of Massachusetts, Amherst majoring in Computer Science. Originally from Longmeadow, MA he now lives in Dallas, TX but missed the snow too much. Interested primarily in back end development with node and will be working towards integration with Google Calendar and Facebook.

Since we intend to provide our application for free and with open source code, we try to minimize the expense as much as we can. 

The most expensive cost will be spent on Advertising. Since we’re a new start-up, we need to promote our products so people have a chance to try it out and provide us useful feedback. We’re gonna have 20$ daily budget for both Google Ads and Facebook Ads, which totals 140$/week. Another way to promote our product is to design our own Swag like T-shirts, stickers, etc with our logo and brand. It does not only boost our company spirit but also raise others’ curiosity about our product. Projected cost of ordering the t-shirts/stickers is around 400$.

Because we are providing an open-source and free product, we consider ourselves “unpaid interns” who want to develop the application to help others rather than gaining economical benefits. However, as a group of enthusiastic and dynamic young people, we need a lot of food and drink to produce high quality code. That’s why we’re gonna spend around 100$/week for “energy supplies”.

Last but not least, Domain and Hosting is gonna takes us around 30$ per month and Office supplies (notes, paper, print …) is also around 50$ per month. We also need to have a monthly budget of 100$/month to spend on any other miscellaneous things.

In total, to run efficiently in the first 3 months, our start-up needs around $4000.
