Santiago De La Torre
Database Analist
>Software engineer brought from the darkest side of Europe looking forward to start writing malicious code. In the meantime, he loves desining databases and fairy-rail queries to store and retrieve data in a minimal time possible. Systems programming is his passion and C isn't only his favourite "vitamin."

__Thai Nguyen__ 
UI/UX Designer, Software Engineer

>An Asian geek who sleeps with Java every night but falls in love with Python instead, who desires to solve challenging back-end problems but also fascinated in creating fabulous UI design. Being a person who favors "high entropy" (in other words: "utmost laziness"), he loves utilizing his computer to save his time and work, that's why he is now craving to learn about Machine Learning and Information Retrieval.

Since we are intend to prove our application for free and with open source code, we try to minimize the expense as much as we can. 

The most expensive cost will be spent for Advertising. Since we’re a new start-up, we need to promote our products so people have a chance to try it out and provide us useful feedbacks. We’re gonna have 20$ daily budget for both Google Ads and Facebook Ads, which takes us totally 140$/week. Another way to promote our product is to designing our own Swag like T-shirt, sticker … with our logo and brand. It does not only boost our company spirit but also raise others’ curiosity about our product. Our budget for these swag is around 400$.

Providing open-source and free product, we consider ourselves as “unpaid interns” who want to develop the application to help others rather than gaining economical benefits. However, as a group of enthusiastic and dynamic young people, we need a lot of food and drink to produce high quality code. That’s why we’re gonna spend around 100$/week for “energy supplies”.

Last but not least, Domain and Hosting is gonna takes us around 30$ per month and Office supplies (notes, paper, print …) is also around 50$ per month. We also need to have a monthly budget of 100$/month to spend for any other miscellaneous things.

Totally, in order to run efficiently in the first 3 months, our start-up needs around $4000.
