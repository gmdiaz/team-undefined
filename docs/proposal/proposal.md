**Santiago De La Torre**
Database Analyst

>Software engineer brought from the darkest side of Europe looking forward to start writing malicious code.

Problem Statement:
------------------
**[Authored by Colin McGinnis and Kiernan Drohan on October 1, 2014]**

People from all backgrounds use many different apps or tools to schedule their lives. But there is so much variation on what tools are used, that sometimes it is easy to get lost in all the schedules that you have floating around. This can make it hard to find the free time that you and one or more people share, so that you can make plans to do something. Believe us, we know from experience. Finding times for our group to meet was very confusing and troublesome at first.

But we hope to change all that and make it easier for people to figure out when their free time overlaps with someone else’s! Through the courses our group has taken outside of the major, such as Introduction to Sociology and Honors 291A: Ideas that Change the World, we have been inspired to find a solution to this scheduling problem. Through Introduction to Sociology, we have learned social interactions play a big role in our lives. They are responsible for so many things, such as cultural growth, the creation of new and innovative ideas that change the world, and just simply making friends. With our new app we want ideas and friendships to have a chance to grow and mature into something greater than they could be individually.

Ideas that Change the World also gave us inspiration to take on this task. First off, as I said earlier, social interactions facilitate ideas that change the world, so that right there is partly inspired by this class as well. However, there were other things we gleaned from that class as well. One idea promoted in Honors291A is being able to take ideas that already exist and improve them. We have been looking to implement this idea by utilizing Google Calendar, but taking it to an entirely new level of connection with your peers. To this extent we will not only improve upon, we will also make a product more tailored to a designated audience of peers with the possibility of expansion to a greater audience as we are able to understand their needs through the scope of our integrative experiences.

Product Description:
--------------------
Nowadays, there are several multi-platform applications that allow you to keep a record of your schedule. When two or more individuals want to meet for any purpose, they have to check their own schedule and present their free time to the people the want to meet with. Other applications, allow you to share your calendar, making other people go over your schedule to figure out when they can meet with you. Going over your schedule or someone else’s every time you want to meet with someone, makes this whole experience completely annoying and inefficient.  
Overlap is multi-platform application that allows users to detect overlaps between their schedule and their friends’ schedule. In that way, individuals can find the perfect time in their schedule to meet for any given purpose. Our complex algorithm and priority sets allow our users to schedule a meeting in a fast and efficient fashion. Being able to connect Overlap with other products allows you to transfer your schedules from other applications, in that way, you do not have to make your schedule from scratch.

Budget:
-------
| Asset            | Rate                 | Cost (3 months) |
|------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Domain + Hosting | 30$/month            | 90$             |
| Development      | 7 unpaid internships | 0$              |
| Advertising      | 140$/week            | 1680$           |
| Swag             | 400$                 | 400$            |
| Food + Drink     | 100$/week            | 1200$           |
| Office supplies  | 50$/month            | 150$            |
| Miscellaneous    | 100$/month           | 300$            |
| Total            |                      | ~4000$          |

Since we intend to provide our application for free and with open source code, we try to minimize the expense as much as we can. 

The most expensive cost will be spent on Advertising. Since we’re a new start-up, we need to promote our products so people have a chance to try it out and provide us useful feedback. We’re gonna have 20$ daily budget for both Google Ads and Facebook Ads, which totals 140$/week. Another way to promote our product is to design our own Swag like T-shirts, stickers, etc with our logo and brand. It does not only boost our company spirit but also raise others’ curiosity about our product. Projected cost of ordering the t-shirts/stickers is around 400$.

Because we are providing an open-source and free product, we consider ourselves “unpaid interns” who want to develop the application to help others rather than gaining economical benefits. However, as a group of enthusiastic and dynamic young people, we need a lot of food and drink to produce high quality code. That’s why we’re gonna spend around 100$/week for “energy supplies”.

Last but not least, Domain and Hosting is gonna takes us around 30$ per month and Office supplies (notes, paper, print …) is also around 50$ per month. We also need to have a monthly budget of 100$/month to spend on any other miscellaneous things.

In total, to run efficiently in the first 3 months, our start-up needs around $4000.
