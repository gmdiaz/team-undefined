Overview:
---------
OOverlap is a multiplatform application that allows users to see when their schedules overlap and when is good for them to schedule professional meetings, hangout, school group meetings. 
Users can connect their social media accounts (Google, Facebook) with their scheduling information and OOverlap will add their schedule automatically. In addition,  when social media accounts are linked to OOverlap, your friends are going to be easy to find. In that way, it will be easier to see when the usersâ€™ schedule overlap with their friends, so they can spend time together by creating social events or professional meetings.
In case the user does not have a social media account, he or she can open an OOverlap account with a regular email address. In that way, companies can schedule professional meetings and events in a more serious manner.
