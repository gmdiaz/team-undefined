Overview:
---------
OOverlap is a multiplatform application that allows users to see when their schedules overlap and when is good for them to schedule professional meetings, hangout, school group meetings. 
Users can connect their social media accounts (Google, Facebook) with their scheduling information and OOverlap will add their schedule automatically. In addition,  when social media accounts are linked to OOverlap, your friends are going to be easy to find. In that way, it will be easier to see when the users’ schedule overlap with their friends, so they can spend time together by creating social events or professional meetings.
In case the user does not have a social media account, he or she can open an OOverlap account with a regular email address. In that way, companies can schedule professional meetings and events in a more serious manner. 

Disclaimer:
-----------
The functional specification of our web application is very straight forward. We load the user’s schedule and we compare them to other user’s schedule to see when they overlap and return the times when two or more schedules don’t overlap so events can be scheduled. Our web application is subject for extension and modification.

Scenarios:
----------

- Scenario 6: <Justin>
The local high school’s chess club is having problems with consistent attendance, all the members have very complicated schedules and they can’t seem to find the right time to hold their weekly meetings. They all upload their schedules to OOverlap, find the perfect time to meet, and attendance skyrockets. They go on to win the world series of chess. 

- Scenario 7: <Justin>
UMass Professor Tim Richards decides that the students in his classes have had it too easy but doesn’t want to have to change the courses material too much. He looks online and stumbles upon OOverlap. He has all his students upload their calendars to find the most convenient times to have assignments due, and then deliberately chooses any other time.

Non-Goals:
----------

- We are here to help people organize their busy lives, not make money. We will not be advertising or monetizing the site in any way. <Justin>
