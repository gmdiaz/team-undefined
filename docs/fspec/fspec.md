Scenarios:
----------

- Scenario 6: <Justin>
The local high school’s chess club is having problems with consistent attendance, all the members have very complicated schedules and they can’t seem to find the right time to hold their weekly meetings. They all upload their schedules to OOverlap, find the perfect time to meet, and attendance skyrockets. They go on to win the world series of chess. 

- Scenario 7: <Justin>
UMass Professor Tim Richards decides that the students in his classes have had it too easy but doesn’t want to have to change the courses material too much. He looks online and stumbles upon OOverlap. He has all his students upload their calendars to find the most convenient times to have assignments due, and then deliberately chooses any other time.
