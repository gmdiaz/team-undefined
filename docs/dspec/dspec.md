What is OOverlap?
-----------------
OOverlap is a scheduling application with the busy college student and professional in mind. Organize meetings with ease by sending out request. Both users will declare their free time and then OOverlap will do the rest - comparing the two schedules and alerting you of compatible meeting times! No more hassle about changing schedules, and no more frustrating back-and-forth emails. In order to enhance your scheduling experience, OOverlap connects with your GoogleCal so that you have your most up-to-date calendar. As you schedule, and confirm, meetings your calendar will update to reflect the newest information. 

Part of a group? Don't worry. OOverlap offers group functionality so that you can easily plan large-scale events or small board meetings. Simply create a group, invite your members, and start planning.

Additionally, with OOverlap's 'priorities' feature you can hierarchically declare you free times. It is in this way that OOverlap overthrows it's competitors.

Components: Bird's Eye View
---------------------------

##Log-in  
This component is fairly self-explanatory as to why it fits in to the website. Without the log-in feature, users will not be able to customize their experience on OOverlap. In order to access all of your personal data (ie. Calendar, Pending Requests, Friends, and Groups) you have to have an account, and in order to access that account you have to log in! Your profile will be your “home page” of sorts. After you log on, you will be taken to your profile page since you should be able to do everything that you need to do from that page.
