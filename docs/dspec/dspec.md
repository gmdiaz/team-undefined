What is OOverlap?
-----------------
OOverlap is a scheduling application with the busy college student and professional in mind. Organize meetings with ease by sending out request. Both users will declare their free time and then OOverlap will do the rest - comparing the two schedules and alerting you of compatible meeting times! No more hassle about changing schedules, and no more frustrating back-and-forth emails. In order to enhance your scheduling experience, OOverlap connects with your GoogleCal so that you have your most up-to-date calendar. As you schedule, and confirm, meetings your calendar will update to reflect the newest information. 

Part of a group? Don't worry. OOverlap offers group functionality so that you can easily plan large-scale events or small board meetings. Simply create a group, invite your members, and start planning.

Additionally, with OOverlap's 'priorities' feature you can hierarchically declare you free times. It is in this way that OOverlap overthrows it's competitors.

Components: Bird's Eye View
---------------------------

###Log-in  
This component is fairly self-explanatory as to why it fits in to the website. Without the log-in feature, users will not be able to customize their experience on OOverlap. In order to access all of your personal data (ie. Calendar, Pending Requests, Friends, and Groups) you have to have an account, and in order to access that account you have to log in! Your profile will be your “home page” of sorts. After you log on, you will be taken to your profile page since you should be able to do everything that you need to do from that page. You should be able to access the login page from: “www.OOverlap.com/login”.

###User Profile
The user profile is yet another important component in the website. As mentioned in the “Log-in” Component description, the User Profile will serve as a “home page” for the user when they are on the website. It will contain all of the information that they need in order to schedule events, access the groups they are members/admins of, and see their calendar. They can also reach their profile settings from their home page. They will be able to reach their user profile from the “Home” button in the navigation that will be placed in the upper right hand corner of screen. They will will be able to access their profile page from: “www.OOverlap.com/[theirLoginUsername]”.

###Settings
The settings component fits in to the website because we are offering the user something that is customizable. In the settings the user can control their privacy settings, profile information (including profile picture, username, password, etc.), calendar preferences, and social network connections. Giving the user the ability to change the as much about their profile as possible makes the website more accessible. The user will be able to access this page from their homepage and by the following link: www.OOverlap.com/[theirLoginusername]/settings
